# Welcome to the Race for the Superstar’s Secret

A new repo surfaced, rumored to be linked to the legendary rival Maddali Shiva Reddy. Strange clues, half-truths, and broken logs are scattered within—but nothing is quite as it seems.

Explore every corner—history is as important as the present.  
Some information is lost in translation, fragmented, or hidden in plain sight.  
Only those who adapt and dig deeper than the rest will be able to piece together what’s missing.

There’s a protected script in this repo.  
There are files that don’t want to give up their secrets easily.  
Good luck discovering the truth behind the mask.
